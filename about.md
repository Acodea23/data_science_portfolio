## TLDR

I'm from Texas and am studying statistics with a minor in mathematics at Brigham Young University. I have co-authored an academic paper in math, and I am currently working on another paper in the field of statistics. Some projects I've worked on include metal fatigue analysis, and vaccine trends based on political affiliation. I want to continue to develop models and statistical processes for complex problems. I would love to chat about your favorite data science projects!

## Who am I?
When I am not doing statistics or data science, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy. I play basketball regularly and play on an intramural team almost every semester. My wife and I love to dance together, so we will take dance classes at BYU, and will also go to social dance clubs in the area. When unwinding through a less physical activity, I enjoy watching sports and reading books.
