    "text": "words to know: scalable, bayesian, prior\nWhen learning to build statisitcal models, the moment the model “fits” the data and your assumptions are met you tend to pat yourself on the back and call it a day. But in the wild, models need to be flexible. They need to be resistant to our prior beliefs potentially bleeding into the model. We will consider how sensitivity relates to these 2 topics.\n\nFlexibility\nLets first consider these two models. Both of them predict the dataLets first consider these two models. Both of them accuratly model the data, but how well will they model another data point from the same sample?\n\n\nCode\n# This code was produced with the aid of Microsoft copilot\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(splines)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Original data\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4), y = c(2, 3, 2.5, 3.5))\n\n# Spline data\nspline_df &lt;- data.frame(x = seq(1, 4, length.out = 100))\nspline_df$y &lt;- predict(smooth.spline(df$x, df$y, df = 4), spline_df$x)$y\n\n# First plot: original model fit\np1 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\", formula = y ~ x) +\n  geom_line(data = spline_df, aes(x, y), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Original Model Fit\", x = \"X\", y = \"Y\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Second plot: with new point\ndf_new_point &lt;- data.frame(x = 3, y = 3.2)\np2 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_point(data = df_new_point, aes(x, y), color = \"green\", size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\", formula = y ~ x) +\n  geom_line(data = spline_df, aes(x, y), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Model Fit with New Point\", x = \"X\", y = \"Y\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Display side by side\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for alternate description\n\nTwo side-by-side plots comparing model fits. The left plot shows four black data points with a blue linear regression line and a red dashed overfitted curve passing through all points. On the right plot, the original lines remain unchanged. There are the same 4 black data points plus a new green data point. The green point has the same x value as another point, but a different y value. The point lies far from the overfitted curve, but close to the linear regression line.\nAlthough the dotted line appeared to be an exceptional model for the data collected, it doesn’t adequately model the whole population. Some model diagnostics will not catch overfitting, and might even tell you that it is an amazing model. In the above example the \\(\\text{MSE} = 0\\). Which would be amazing. The problem is that this model isn’t flexible enough to accuratly predict future observations, nor to provide correct confidence intervals. We need a model that is more flexible to handle variance in the data.\n\nProblems\nLet’s discuss a couple potential problems leading to overfitting. - Too many predictors - Multicolliniearity - Sample size\n\nPredictors\nIn a world saturated with data, sometimes less is more. Especially when it comes to the number of predictors we use.\n\n\nMulticolliniearity\n\n\nSample Size\n\n\n\nPotential Fix"
