# Hello! I'm Matthew Wilson üëã

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This site shows my journey learning data science and analytics. On this website you will find past data projects that focus on statistical skills in R, and current project that focs on Data Science skills in Python. I hope you find something that interests you and reach out to chat about my work!

## üéì About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. My goal is to help you to understand the skills I would offer as an employee. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
