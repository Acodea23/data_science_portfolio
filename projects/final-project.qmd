# 
# # Split the data
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# 
# # Scale features if necessary
# scaler = StandardScaler()
# X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
# X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the model
# from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# model1 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
# model1.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions
# y_pred = model1.predict(X_test_scaled)
# 
# # Evaluate performance
# accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
